# C++ GAME
# DICE ROLLER
This is a Dice Roller C++ game that I worked on. It is an easy game that uses C language to run it.

It simulates a roll of a Dice and then gives the output.

It also allows multiple players, amultiple rounds and then makes a leaderborad for the results.

There is a visualization for the output.

I have explained what each step does on the code.

I modified code from: https://mmmcmillan1957.medium.com/programming-dice-games-in-c-an-introduction-to-c-programming-714a9f8c4f4e
